### Disclaimer
Please, **do not go** to Discord to get support for Duvbox.
Duvbox relies on technology that is against the Discord *Terms of Service* (client mods such as Powercord & BetterDiscord) and it is likely your account will be terminated.

## Known Issues
- On the Add Guild modal, Discord forces light theme even on dark theme.
